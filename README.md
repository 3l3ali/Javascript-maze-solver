### 'Purpose of the project'

This project was made out of enthusiasim for graph theory, wanted to test around and explore React so found this project as a great opporunity to do so, inspired from an previous Google Engineer.

### 'What to expect'

The program is simple, it draws a 2d maze on broweser, and you have a starting point and an ending point, you get to choose your favorite traversing algorithm and watch how the node explores the paths around it to reach the ending point.

### 'Is there going to be more?'

Absoultly! as a master's student it gets boring sometimes so I love adding new features, here is a list of the features that are expected to come.

1. Clear button
2. Algorithm panel, add more algorithms and seperate the class in code.
3. Add the ability for the user to try and solve the maze on their own and add a comparing score between optimal and their solution.
4. Add a tutorial guide for better UX.
5. Add the ability for the user to draw their own walls.
6. Add the ability for the user to create custom maps and save them.
7. Add the ability for two users to join as a multiplayer game and race to see who reaches the end path faster and who has the more optimal answer.
